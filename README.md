## Helpful to download but not required:
- Install BloodHound 
  - https://support.bloodhoundenterprise.io/hc/en-us/articles/17468450058267-Install-BloodHound-Community-Edition-with-Docker-Compose
  - Note, this may not work with the current collectors outside of SharpHound as BloodHound CE is less than 1 week old as I write this
- Install BloodHound Legacy (if you can't get a CE collection)
